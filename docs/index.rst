Welcome to  GNSS_visualization_tools' documentation!
====================================================

Contents:
---------

The aim of the project is to compare simulated and broadcast data. For that you will be able to
create scenario that you want to launch on a Multi-GNSS Simulator Spectracom,
to run this scenario and then, thanks to a simple graphical interface visualize a range of data
coming from the simulator and the receiver(s).

The main documentation for the site is organized into a couple sections:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :glob:
   :caption: Define your scenario

   define_the_scenario

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
